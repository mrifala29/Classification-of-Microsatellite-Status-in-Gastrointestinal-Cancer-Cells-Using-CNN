Microsatelite is a unique type of recurrent  genomic circuit that is spread throughout the genome and  exhibits a high level of allele polymorphism.The microsatelite  state turns unstable due to a mismatch repair deoxyribonucleic  acid system error.Identification of microsatelite status can be  done using deep learning method, Convolutional Neural  Networks (CNN).There have been several studies using CNN in  this case, but there are problems with model stability and  accuracy resulting in less than the maximum that may be caused  by overfitting.Based on the problem, the study proposed CNN  method by proposing modification of VGG19 model then adding  augmentation and dropout after pooling layer (APL).The data  used is an image of colorectal and gastric cancer cells.In  colorectal cancer cells, the proposed model obtained an  accuracy of 76.2%, the addition of augmentation gained an  accuracy of 77.1%, then gave the APL dropout lowering  accuracy to 76.3%.While in gastric cancer cells testing was  conducted using a proposed model with augmentation and the  addition of callbacks obtained accuracy of 76%.The proposed  model is still overfitting, but augmentation can slightly address  overfitting and improve accuracy.While the APL dropout  lowers accuracy but provides a stable development of accuracy  charts and no indication of overfitting.
